# Death and Taxes: Survivor

**The only thing certain is death and taxes.**

_"Tax returns, I've done so many tax returns."_

_How long have you been an accountant? Two decades? Maybe five? Time has no meaning anymore. As an overworked tax accountant at the big firm downtown, you struggle with the never-ending flow of tax return after tax return. The madness must stop..._

_Late one evening, you doze off at your desk, only to awaken to the two things that are certain: **death and taxes**._
